Lab 8 - Digital Stopwatch

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Review the conceptual operation of a timer interrupt.

  a. For a 16-bit timer with clock frequency of 16MHz (like the Arduino) and
  prescalar of 64, how much time corresponds to a timer value of 2000?

	0.008 Seconds

	We solve for X:
	(16,000,000 * X) / 64 = 2000

  b. With a clock frequency of 16MHz and prescalar of 8, what is the longest
  amount of time we can track with an 8-bit hardware timer.

	0.000128 Seconds

	We solve for X:
	(16,000,000 * X) / 8 = 256
	2^8 = 256

2. (2 points) We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device. To that end, open the ATmega328/P
datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page. The Timer we
have used also has the ability to make an output pin turn ON (set), OFF
(clear), or Toggle when the timer reaches the OCR1A value (i.e. in addition to
generating an interrupt, the hardware can automatically toggle or turn an
output on or off). By searching the data sheet and using the information in
section 16.11.1 (especially table 16-1) answer the following questions:

  a. Which two pins can TIMER 1 (the 16-bit) timer control (i.e. what pins are
  associated with OC1A and OC1B)?  Look at Figure 1.1 (upper right diagram of
  the "28 PDIP" package) on page 12 of the data sheet, or Table 14-3, 14-6, or
  14-9 to find this info.

	PB1 and PB2 are related to OC1A and OC1B that are controlled by TIMER 1 looking at the page.

  b. In this lab we use TIMER1 in the "Clear Timer on Compare" or CTC mode.  In
  this mode when the counter reaches the value in OCR1A register it generates
  an interrupt and starts counting again from zero.  Using the information in
  section 16.11.1 and table 16-1, describe what the OC1A and OC1B pins would do
  when the timer reaches the OCR1A value if during initialization we used the
  statement TCCR1A |= 0x60;

	- With TCCR1A |= 0x60, COM1A0 would be 1 and COM1b1 would be 1, and the corresponding values in the table states that this will set OC1A/OC1B on Compare Match (which sets outputs to high level). Toggles to high.
