EE 109 - Fall 2021
Lab 6 - Analog to Digital Conversion

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (3 points) Review the conceptual operation of an ADC and use the given
parameters to find the desired value.

  a. Your 8-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 1V and 4V, what digital
  number would result from sampling a 2.0V?

	



  b. Your 5-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 0V and 5V, what input
  voltage would yield a digital number of 12?




  c.  Your 6-bit ADC has a Lo reference voltages of 2V. A voltage is sampled at
  2.4V and the digital result is 26. What was the Hi reference voltage used by
  the ADC?



2. (1 point) We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device.  To that end, open the ATmega328/P
datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page and go to chapter
24 regarding the ADC.  In our current lab, the ADC only takes samples when
commanded through the ADSC bit in the ADCSRA register.  However, the ADC can be
configured to take continuous samples based on some other triggering source.
Read over the register bit descriptions of the ADCSRA register (especially bit
5 = ADATE) and the ADCSRB register (especially bits ADTS[2:0]) described in
sections 24.9.2 and 24.9.4, respectively.  In addition, in section 24.4,
directly above Figure 24-4 is the text:

   "In Free Running mode, a new conversion will be started immediately after
   the conversion completes, while ADSC remains high."

Now consider what effect setting the ADATE bit of ADCSRA to a 1 will have,
assuming you donâ€™t modify ADCSRB from its default reset value.  Briefly
describe what the ADC module will do.
