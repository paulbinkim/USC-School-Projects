Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit 2. Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

- The approach is wrong because it clears all of the bits except bit 2, and this in return, gets rid of the initialized pull-up resistors.


2. (2 points) Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple
measurements?  Think about the timing of how software executes.

- The delay between the press of the 'C' button varies because software can only read one line at a time. Therefore, in the while loop, the position you are in the loop, affects the timing of the output of the software code.
