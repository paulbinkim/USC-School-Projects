Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kOhm", or "200 mV".

Note: Don't use special characters like Greek "mu" or "Omega" symbols in your
answers.  These don't display correctly on Vocareum and can make it hard to
grade the answers.  For example, if you need to specify units of microseconds,
just type "microseconds" or "usecs".


1. (1 point) What voltage did the DMM measure?

        DMM =  2.58 V

2. What are the values of the resistors?  List the values from smallest to
   largest.
   (1.5 points) From the color bands:

	R1 =  240 (10%) Ohms
	R2 =  680 (5%) Ohms
	R3 =  1300 (5%) Ohms
         
   (1.5 points) The measured values:

        R1 =  235.8 Ohms
        R2 =  682.2 Ohms
        R3 =  1278.3 Ohms


3. (2 points) In the circuit with Vs=5V and resistors R1 and R2 in series what
   are the CALCULATED voltages across them?

        V1 =  1.284 V
        V2 =  3.716 V


4. (2 points) In the circuit with Vs=5V and resistors R1 and R2 in series what
   are the MEASURED voltages across them?

        V1 =  1.284 V
        V2 =  3.716 V


5. (1 points) What are the voltages (or range of voltages after watching for a
few seconds) on the switch output when it is not pressed and when it is
pressed?

        Not pressed =  0.3 - 0.35 V
        Pressed =  0.011 - 0.013 mV

6. (1 points) With resistor R2 added to the circuit, what are the voltages on
   the switch output when it is not pressed and when it is pressed?

        Not pressed =  4.9995 - 4.9999 V
        Pressed =  0.55 - 0.6 mV

7. (2 points) Using the values you just measured for the voltages across R1 and
R3, and the values you measured previously for those resistor values, use Ohm's
Law to calculate the current that was passing through the resistors in both
cases.

                  Voltage     Resistance     Current
        R1:       3.0281 V    235.8 Ohms     0.01284 Amps
        R3:       2.9141 V    1278.3 Ohms    0.002280 Amps

8. (2 points) What were the values that you measured with the DMM in current
mode for the current flowing through the LED for both R1 or R3?
	          Current

	R1:       ~0.013 Amps
        R3:        ~0.0023 Amps

			  ---- Review Questions ----

1. (3 points) Given the digital circuit you built with the button, inverter and
LED, suppose as you test it the output LED is always OFF regardless of the
button position.  For each of the following possible explanations, write a
sentence that explains why that issue would cause the LED to always be
off.

     a. VDD was not connected to the IC chips.

	- If the VDD (Voltage Source) was not connected to the IC Chips, that implies that there is 			
	basically no power source, therefore, the LED's will always be off. (No Voltage = No Power)

     b. The ground connection for the button was not connected appropriately.

	- If the connection was not set up properly for the button, there would be no two electrical 
	contacts will allow the voltage to flow to another.

     c. The LED was plugged in backwards.

	- Current can only flow from the anode to the cathode for LED's, but not the other way 
	around. Therefore, no current would be passing through the LED.

2. (2 points) Given two resistors Rlo and Rhi whose resistance values are such that Rlo < Rhi

     a. If they are connected in series giving a series effective resistance of
     Reff, which of the following is true?

         Rhi < Reff

     b. If they are connected in parallel, giving a parallel effective
     resistance of Reff, which of the following is true?

         Reff < Rlo

3. (1 point) True or False: Ohm's Law applies to both LEDs and resistors.

	- False, LED's do not obey Ohm's Law (only applies to resistors)
