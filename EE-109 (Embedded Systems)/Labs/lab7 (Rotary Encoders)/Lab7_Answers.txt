EE 109 - Fall 2021
Lab 7 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 point) Briefly explain why it is undesirable to read the two encoder
input signals with two separate PINC statements.

  - It is undesirable to read the two input signals with two separate PINC statements because you would rather collect the PINC value that corresponds to both A and B at once. To further elaborate, by making PINC into a variable, the variable will capture a single PINC signal that represents both A and B. However, if you were to call PINC at two instances, there is a strong possibility that by rotating the encoder, it PINC may capture different signals(inaccurate) due to a fast spin.


2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.
  - Updating the LCD in the ISR is bad behavior because of the idea that an interrupt cannot interrupt another interrupt. This is a problem if we put the LCD display change in the ISR because, if there was a change in the count, WHILE you are in the interrupt, you will miss that count, and further, miss a-lot of more things. Therefore, that is why we do not do time consuming tasks in the ISR.
