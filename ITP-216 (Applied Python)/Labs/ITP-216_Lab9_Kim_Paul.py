    1. What is the element tag that holds "about"
        HTML <a> tag

    2. Once you identify that element: what is the value of its class attribute?
        "menu-link"

    *A little confused what "about" meant because there were 19 instances of "about" in the inspector of the Website
    *I assumed the "about" drop down menu
    *Just so I show significant effort

    <a class="menu-link" href="https://about.usc.edu/">About</a>

    <a> is the element tag
    "menu-link" is the value of the class attribute
