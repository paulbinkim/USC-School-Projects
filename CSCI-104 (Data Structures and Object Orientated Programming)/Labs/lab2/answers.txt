Problem 1
- On line 249, invaders[invaderRow][invaderRow] = new Warrior();, the second parameter of invaders was wrong and the fix was to change invaderRow to invaderCol.

Problem 2
- Line 32, was a problem where the function had two if's statements. The fix was to change the 2nd if to else if. 
- I think line 27 also had a semicolon that I had to remove which was a syntax error.

Problem 3
- Line 62, ++colIdx needed to be added, because colIdx was not being iterated.

Problem 4
- Line 218 and Line 219, the parameters were off. n had to come before m for protectors, and m had to come before n for invaders.

Problem 5
-  Lines 114 and Lines 118, I had to flip the signs. Logical error.
