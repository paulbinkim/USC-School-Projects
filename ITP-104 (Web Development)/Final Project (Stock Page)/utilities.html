		<h1>The Utilities Sector</h1>

		<hr>

		<h2>What is the Utilities Sector?</h2>
		<p>The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. Although utilities earn profits, they are part of the public service landscape and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to inject steady income in their portfolios.</p>

		<p>​Utilities typically offer investors stable and consistent dividends, coupled with less price volatility relative to the overall equity markets. Because of these facts, utilities tend to perform well during recessionary climates. Contrarily, utility stocks tend to fall out of favor with the market, during times of economic growth.</p>

		<p>The many types of utilities available include large companies that offer multiple services such as electricity and natural gas. Other utility interest might specialize in just one type of service, such as water. Some utilities rely on clean and renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels, to produce electricity. Investors may also purchase regional utilities or invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) containing baskets of utility stocks located throughout the U.S.</p>

		<h2>What is the Market Capitalization?</h2>

		<p>The total market value of all companies accross the Utilities sector is <u>$1.51 trillion.</u></p>

		<h2>What is the Market Sector Performance?</h2>

		<p>Looking at the 3 year lifespand till January 
		2020, Utilites were up <u>+100.42%</u> for the decade.</p>
