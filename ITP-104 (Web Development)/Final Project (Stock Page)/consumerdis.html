		<h1>The Consumer Discretionary Sector</h1>

		<hr>

		<h2>What is the Consumer Discretionary Sector?</h2>
		<p>Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.</p>

		<p>​The purchase of consumer discretionary products is often discussed in comparison with its counterpart: consumer staples. Both product classifications are influenced by cycles of the economy. In general, when the economy is strong, consumers earn more and spend more on consumer discretionary products. On the other hand, when an economy is in contractionary phases, consumers usually earn less and focus their spending more on consumer staples, also referred to as consumer defensive.</p>

		<p>When an economy is growing, it is usually expected that its consumers would have more disposable income to spend on discretionary items and less concern over saving for tough times. This leads to a greater demand for consumer discretionary products.</p>

		<h2>What is the Market Capitalization?</h2>

		<p>The total market value of all companies accross the Consumer Discretionary sector is <u>$7.56 trillion.</u></p>

		<h2>What is the Market Sector Performance?</h2>

		<p>Looking at the 10 year lifespand till January 
		2020, Consumer Discretionary was up <u>+337.74%</u> for the decade.</p>
