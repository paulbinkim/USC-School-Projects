		<h2>What is the Consumer Staples Sector?</h2>
		<p>Consumer staples are essential products that include typical products such as foods & beverage, household goods, and hygiene products; but the category also includes such items as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable—or unwilling—to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.</p>

		<p>​Consumer staples are considered to be non-cyclical, meaning that they are always in demand, year-round, no matter how well the economy is—or is not—performing. As such, consumer staples are impervious to business cycles. Also, people tend to demand consumer staples at a relatively constant level, regardless of their price.</p>

		<p>Comprising nearly 70% of the nation’s gross national product (GNP), consumer spending holds a lot of sway over the economy. Economic growth and decline are typically led by consumer spending, which is cyclical. Cyclical means there are ebbs and flows, or times when the consumer spends more and periods when they have more conservative spending habits.</p>

		<h2>What is the Market Capitalization?</h2>

		<p>The total market value of all companies accross the Consumer Staples sector is <u>$4.04 trillion.</u></p>

		<h2>What is the Market Sector Performance?</h2>

		<p>Looking at the 3 year lifespand till January 
		2020, Consumer Staples was up <u>+122.61%</u> for the decade.</p>
