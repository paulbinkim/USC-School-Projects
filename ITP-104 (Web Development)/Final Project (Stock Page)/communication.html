		<h1>The Communication Services Sector</h1>

		<hr>

		<h2>What is the Communication Services Sector?</h2>
		<p>The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and internet service providers.</p>

		<p>​At one time, telecommunications required physical wires connecting homes and businesses. In contemporary society, technology has gone mobile. Now, wireless digital technology is becoming the primary form of communication.</p>

		<p>Of all the customer markets, residential and small business markets are arguably the toughest. With literally hundreds of players in the market, competitors rely heavily on price to slog it out for households' monthly checks; success rests largely on brand name strength and heavy investment in efficient billing systems. The corporate market, on the other hand, remains the industry's favorite. Big corporate customers, who are concerned mostly about the quality and reliability of their telephone calls and data delivery, are less price-sensitive than residential customers. Large multinationals, for instance, spend heavily on telecom infrastructure to support far-flung operations. They are also happy to pay for premium services like high-security private networks and video-conferencing.</p>

		<h2>What is the Market Capitalization?</h2>

		<p>The total market value of all companies accross the Communication Services sector is <u>$5.52 trillion.</u></p>

		<h2>What is the Market Sector Performance?</h2>

		<p>Looking at the 10 year lifespand till January 
		2020, Communication Services was up <u>+69.87%</u> for the decade.</p>
