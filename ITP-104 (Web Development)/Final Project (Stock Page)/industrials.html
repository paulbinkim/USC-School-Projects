		<h2>What is the Industrials Sector?</h2>
		<p>The Industrials Sector includes companies whose businesses are dominated by one of the following activities: The manufacture and distribution of capital goods, including aerospace & defense, construction, engineering & building products, electrical equipment and industrial machinery. The provision of commercial services and supplies, including printing, employment, environmental and office services. The provision of transportation services, including airlines, couriers, marine, road & rail and transportation infrastructure.</p>

		<p>The industrial goods sector is a category of stocks of companies who produce capital goods used in construction and manufacturing. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.</p>

		<p>When the economy contracts during recessions, activity in this sector drops because companies postpone expansion and produce fewer goods. However, with this sector covering a wide range of subsectors, there is usually at least one area of growth in the industrial goods sector. The industrial goods sector goes through life cycles that see different subsectors in growth phases.</p>

		<h2>What is the Market Capitalization?</h2>

		<p>The total market value of all companies accross the Industrials sector is <u>$4.47 trillion.</u></p>

		<h2>What is the Market Sector Performance?</h2>

		<p>Looking at the 10 year lifespand till January 
		2020, Industrials were up <u>+138.42%</u> for the decade.</p>
