		<h1>The Real Estate Sector</h1>

		<hr>

		<h2>What is the Real Estate Sector?</h2>
		<p>A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.</p>

		<p>​Properties in a REIT portfolio may include apartment complexes, data centers, healthcare facilities, hotels, infrastructure—in the form of fiber cables, cell towers, and energy pipelines—office buildings, retail centers, self-storage, timberland, and warehouses.</p>

		<p>Many REITs are publicly traded on major securities exchanges, and investors can buy and sell them like stocks throughout the trading session. These REITs typically trade under substantial volume and are considered very liquid instruments. </p>

		<h2>What is the Market Capitalization?</h2>

		<p>The total market value of all companies accross the Real Estate sector is <u>$1.33 trillion.</u></p>

		<h2>What is the Market Sector Performance?</h2>

		<p>Looking at the 3 year lifespand till January 
		2020, Real Estate was up <u>+9.28%</u> for the decade.</p>
