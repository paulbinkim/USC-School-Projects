		<h1>The Financial Sector</h1>

		<hr>

		<h2>What is the Financial Sector?</h2>
		<p>The financial sector is a section of the economy made up of firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.</p>

		<p>A large portion of this sector generates revenue from mortgages and loans, which gain value as interest rates drop. The health of the economy depends, in large part, on the strength of its financial sector. The stronger it is, the healthier the economy. A weak financial sector typically means the economy is weakening.</p>

		<p>Many people equate the financial sector with Wall Street and the exchanges that operate on it. But there's much more to it than that. The financial sector is one of the most important parts of many developed economies. It is made up of brokers, financial institutions, and money markets—all of which provide the services needed to help keep Main Street functioning every day.</p>

		<h2>What is the Market Capitalization?</h2>

		<p>The total market value of all companies accross the Financial sector is <u>$5.94 trillion.</u></p>

		<h2>What is the Market Sector Performance?</h2>

		<p>Looking at the 10 year lifespand till January 
		2020, Financials were up <u>+97.73%</u> for the decade.</p>
