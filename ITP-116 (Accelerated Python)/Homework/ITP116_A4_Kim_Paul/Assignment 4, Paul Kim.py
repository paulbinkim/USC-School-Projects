# Description:
# Program that takes a look at Gordon Ramsay's Bank Balance
# That stores user input, outputs information, utilizes arithmetic operators
# Compare values with boolean expressions, use conditional statements to alter behavior
# And utilizes loops to repeat certain blocks based on a condition.

Balance = 0  # Initializing a Bank Balance of $

# Printing initialization output statement
